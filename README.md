## 1. Order Customization
#### Poblano allows you to select an entree and customize it to your liking. Once you build an order, you can name the meal, and add it to your bag.

## 2. Nutrition Calculator
#### You can calculate the percent breakdown and total amount of calories, fats, and proteins by using Poblano's Nutrition Calculator. This is implemented by a Recharts API, which allows you to pass data and render a responsive Pie-Chart on the client-side. You can play around with it to see the nutritional content for your ideal customized meal is or for an individual ingredient.

## 3. User Authentication.
#### You can sign in using a demo login or create an account for yourself. On the front-end, Poblano uses JavaScript and regular expressions to validate user input and show various requirements that the user must fill out. Once a user logs in, they can click on their profile to see how many reward points they have and they can sign out through their profile page.

## Features I'd like to add
* Google Maps API for store locations and selecting a nearby store
* Finish adding small features to the bag side modal
